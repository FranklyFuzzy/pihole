# Firebog Block Lists

Save time. Dont copy and paste 30+ individual block lists...

blocklist.py scrapes the firebog.net collection of block lists, gathers all the URLs that have a green check mark (indicating they are verified/maintained) and prints those URLs in a format that you can copy and paste the output directly into your Pi hole adlist address box.
